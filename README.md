# ILS_2019_MIS500

This is a repository containing an assignment completed for a graduate level course in programming in Python.
The dataset is a .csv containing a log of Iowa Liquor Sales from 2019, but was too large to include in this repository.
The two files are divided up into Part 1 and Part 2, and the instructions are included at the top of the assignment.
The code is also commented for ease of reading and comprehension.
